# Pure graphrag
This repository contains a Python application that demonstrates how to use Neo4j for graph-based data storage and querying, combined with LangChain's LLM capabilities (using the Ollama LLaMA 2:7b model) to generate answers to questions based on the graph data.

## Features
1. Connect to a Neo4j database and execute queries.
2. Fetch and process data from the graph database.
3. Use LangChain with the Ollama LLaMA model to generate natural language answers based on graph data.
4. using the graph data generate a formatted answer.
